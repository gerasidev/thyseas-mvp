# $THYSEAS Protocol

> **The first crypto bank that creates 10–25× leverage to fund machines that move atoms — not real estate.**

![THYSEAS Hero](src/assets/hero.png)

## 🌍 Overview

**$THYSEAS** is a BTC-pegged stablecoin and lending protocol designed exclusively for deep-tech hardware startups (robotics, chips, synthetic biology, advanced energy, drones, exoskeletons, etc.).

We are building a future where capital flows to those building the physical infrastructure of tomorrow, not just digital speculation.

### 🔑 Core Principles
1. **1 $THYSEAS = 1 BTC worth of value forever**: Stability maintained through provenance arbitrage.
2. **Hardware Backed**: Loans are over-collateralized by physical hardware (tokenized robots, chips, lab equipment).
3. **No Real Estate**: We fund innovation, not landlords.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Stablecoin ($THYSEAS)**: ERC-20 token pegged 1:1 to Bitcoin.
- **Deep-Tech Lending**: Borrow up to 25x against verified hardware collateral.
- **RWA Tokenization**: Turn robots, GPUs, and bioreactors into liquid assets (ERC-721).
- **Community Audited**: Decentralized verification of loan applications and collateral health.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, Vite, TypeScript
- **Styling**: Vanilla CSS (Deep-Tech Design System), Framer Motion
- **Blockchain**: (Planned) Arbitrum + Bitcoin Anchoring (tBTC/Rootstock)
